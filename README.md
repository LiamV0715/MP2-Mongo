# Milestone Project 2: Pets Application

## Description

This group project features a website dedicated to pets! The user is able to view, edit, delete, and create a pet. 

### Background

---

This MERN stack application was submitted as the second major project for our Software Development Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a MERN stack application to showcase our backend knowledge and proficiency in MongoDB, JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

### Challenges & Solutions

---

The beginning stages of the project were challenging as this was our first group project and by far the most complicated assignment in the program. After landing on an idea for our application, we created mockups using Adobe Illustrator to get an idea of styling and layout.

Knowing where to start and how to distribute the work was a challenge. We created a shared Google Doc to outline tasks and begin the planning process.
